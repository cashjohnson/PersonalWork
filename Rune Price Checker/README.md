# Problem: I have recently been playing around with Runescape again (just for nostalgia's sake) and ran
# into the problem that I was short on money and wanted an easy way to make it! According to this link
# http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Money_making_guide/Buying_runes I would be able to make a nice sum in a short
# amount of time depending on the market. Being lazy and assuming I might do this multiple times I decided to make
# a tool that would tell me where/which runes to buy from vendors and sell on the Grand Exchange (a central
# auction house in the game).
